# 🧩 DataStructures

A collection of **core data structure implementations in C#**, designed for practice, learning, and mastery of fundamental computational building blocks.

This repository contains several custom data structures implemented from scratch to reinforce understanding of internal mechanics, reference handling, and algorithmic behavior.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was created to:

- Practice implementing essential data structures without relying on built-in collections
- Understand memory and reference behavior in C#
- Explore performance characteristics of common structures
- Build foundations for algorithms and software design

---

## 🚀 Included Implementations

✔ Singly linked lists  
✔ Stacks  
✔ Queues  
✔ Binary tree basics (if included)  
✔ Other classic data structures

Each implementation reinforces how the data structure works *internally*, rather than simply using framework types.
